kind: Service
metadata:
  name: tpm-frontend
spec:
  # clusterIP is set by default if no type is chosen, it allows the service to be accessible inside of the cluster, but not from the outside,
  # for that an ingress/loadbalancer/nodePort is needed
  # At this point in digital ocean you can apply a loadbalancer instead of a clusterIP, this will make it accessible for external traffic!
  type: LoadBalancer
  # type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: tpm-frontend
  ports:
    - name: https
      protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      targetPort: 3000
## 443 is the default for https requests while 80 is for http (unsecure requests), right now accessing port 443 will be insecure but when adding tls certificate it will become https (secure http)
