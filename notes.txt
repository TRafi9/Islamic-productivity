note - to add to readme, instructions on how to launch via docker, make sure to mount those env vars that are needed to connect to postgres when running via docker

TODO - ask about how to know what image to use for docker images




TODO CONTINUE - continue debugging interval code and writing section on how dates updates work in notes! + debug the issue with getting data from postgres instance


BACKEND DOCKER COMMAND

docker run -e USER=test-user-tpm -e CONNECTION_NAME=starlit-booster-408007:europe-west2:the-productive-muslim -e PASSWORD='1SVyqShEUD0Pil' -e DB_NAME=postgres -p 8080:8080 tpm_backend 

DOCKER COMPOSE STUFF
docker-compose up --build


how date updates work:

formattedDate var is a usestate, initially set to todays date.
there is an initialDelay value that calculates the time left till 5 mins past the next day.
once that time is reached a updateDate function is run which gets the date for the new day and sets formattedDate to the new day (this code runs every 24 hours, so 00:05 everyday)
since formattedDate will now be changed, a use effect that is triggered off formattedDate runs, this useEffect gets the data for todays prayers and sets it in todaysPrayers var.
a new value for todaysPrayers will trigger another useEffect to run, this useEffect updates the names and times for current prayer, last prayer and next prayer.
