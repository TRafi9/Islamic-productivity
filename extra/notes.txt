getting jwt sent via cookies back and forth and created restricted api, need to continue implementing for all restricted paths,
- there is a bug where 


- also need to check if frontend my stats page is hitting backend api call correctly
- jwt Auth is good as checks against secret value, but need to check in handler if claims from token are correct, and if so can continue function - set this up for todaysPrayers

- finish testing login workflow
- next step is to double check login /create user workflow and then figure out how to handle the JWT token that has been created
- adding claims to jwt token, passing in response to frontend, also adding secure middleware"
- need to test functionality on resend verification code
- need to add loading spinner when user creates a login and hits register, make a component for this

1. check if prayerTimes are running
2. get jwt from prayerTimes function in backend from cookie
3. add middleware, remove getting cookie, see if it is blocking

DOCKER COMPOSE STUFF
docker-compose up --build


how date updates work:

formattedDate var is a usestate, initially set to todays date.
there is an initialDelay value that calculates the time left till 5 mins past the next day.
once that time is reached a updateDate function is run which gets the date for the new day and sets formattedDate to the new day (this code runs every 24 hours, so 00:05 everyday)
since formattedDate will now be changed, a use effect that is triggered off formattedDate runs, this useEffect gets the data for todays prayers and sets it in todaysPrayers var.
a new value for todaysPrayers will trigger another useEffect to run, this useEffect updates the names and times for current prayer, last prayer and next prayer.
