TODO CONTINUE -  
- finish testing login workflow, also fix cors responses: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52897253/fetch-request-returning-status-cors-and-readable-stream
- next step is to double check login /create user workflow and then figure out how to handle the JWT token that has been created
- need to also add in resend email verification as there is now an expirytime value check
- need to add loading spinner when user creates a login and hits register, make a component for this
- update error messages on verification code reset page on frontend + backend handler func and test to see if correct errs are displayed to user


DOCKER COMPOSE STUFF
docker-compose up --build


how date updates work:

formattedDate var is a usestate, initially set to todays date.
there is an initialDelay value that calculates the time left till 5 mins past the next day.
once that time is reached a updateDate function is run which gets the date for the new day and sets formattedDate to the new day (this code runs every 24 hours, so 00:05 everyday)
since formattedDate will now be changed, a use effect that is triggered off formattedDate runs, this useEffect gets the data for todays prayers and sets it in todaysPrayers var.
a new value for todaysPrayers will trigger another useEffect to run, this useEffect updates the names and times for current prayer, last prayer and next prayer.
