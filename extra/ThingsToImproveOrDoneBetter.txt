- need to add loading spinner when register button is clicked

- can add button disables for 10s etc to make sure user cannot spam buttons to call backend for ddos attacks e.g. reset email verification button can be disabled for 10s
after clicked


- could have had a db that matched GUID to users email instead of using email as primary key as that isnt great practice

- could create a config for components that could be altered in the future, e.g. table names and database names and pass them through using viper
- could hold all sql under one sql files area and call them correctly
